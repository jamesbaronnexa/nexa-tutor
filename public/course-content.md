WHY WE NEED THIS TRAINING

At Sony Pictures Entertainment, we believe in inclusive work environments and recognize that the foundation for innovation is formed by a diverse group of employees, full of dreams and curiosities.

When we're aware of our biases and work to mitigate them, we're more likely to work in ways that give everyone a chance to shine.

WHAT IS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS?

Unconscious bias occurs when we automatically and unintentionally judge people based on race, gender, age, appearance or a host of other factors.

These biases can be formed at any point throughout our lives, but for many people, they can appear in our formative years, as children and young adults.

These biases can be picked up through TV shows, conversations we hear around the home, or from our social circles. We might not necessarily engage with these little messages consciously, but our brain is a clever thing. It picks up information, even without us knowing, and thinks, 'I'll log that as it will help me navigate my way through life.'

"Our brains are wired for efficiency, not for accuracy. The more we rely on mental shortcuts, the more we risk making unfair judgments."
â€” Dr. Daniel Kahneman, psychologist and author of Thinking, Fast and Slow.

TIME FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP

Let's be honest - we've all had biased thoughts or made snap judgments, whether we realised it at the time or not. The good news? Becoming aware of this is a powerful first step.

Think of a time you demonstrated unconscious bias with someone you work with. For example:

You chose to work with a colleague because you have lots in common.

You asked for someone's input on an exciting project because they work next to you.

Remember your example as you work through this training. We will come back to it.
