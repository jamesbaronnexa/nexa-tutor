# Leading with Aroha: Positive Guidance in Practice

## Slide 101: What is Positive Guidance?

Positive guidance is proactively helping children grow and learn by teaching and reinforcing appropriate behaviours through encouragement, clear expectations, and supportive relationships rather than punishment.

**Interactive Elements:**
- Click the images to reveal the core aims of positive guidance:
  - To decrease and stop negative behaviours.
  - To support and guide tamariki to develop social & emotional competencies.
  - To keep tamariki safe, as well as others and property.
  - To support and guide tamariki towards pro-social behaviours.

## Slide 102: It's all about relationships

Relationships are the foundation of positive guidance because children are more likely to listen, learn, and grow when they feel safe, seen, and valued. Strong, trusting relationships create the emotional safety tamariki need to explore boundaries, develop self-regulation, and make good choices. Without connection, guidance can feel like control - but with connection, it becomes guiding & teaching.

## Slide 103: Meet Zoe and Tariki

Zoe recently started work at BestStart as a caregiver. Let's read about her interactions with Tariki, one of the tamariki at the Centre.

**Interactive Elements:**
- Click the arrows to see what happens.
- Tariki is a four-year-old child who is autistic and is highly sensitive to sound. During free play, the room becomes loud with music and chatter. Tariki begins to cover his ears, shouts, and eventually throws a toy.
- Zoe tells Tariki firmly that throwing toys is not acceptable and removes him from the area for a time-out.
- Tariki becomes distressed. He temporarily stops shouting, but he becomes more and more introverted, and is unable to rejoin the play area once the time-out is over. He sits with his hands over his ears and is visibly distressed. He refuses to speak to Zoe.
- Zoe's actions were not in keeping with a positive guidance approach. They focused on controlling the behaviour without understanding or addressing the underlying need - and missed a key opportunity to support social and emotional competence skills through coaching, or build trust & relationship through connection & understanding.
- It turns out that Zoe was unaware of the strategies that would support Tariki's behaviour concerning his autism, outlined in his ILP, and had not received an induction on positive guidance when she started working at the centre.
- The outcome of this interaction is Tariki feels misunderstood, unsafe or confused. The underlying cause of this behaviour was missed and the relationship weakened.
- Tariki is a four-year-old child who is autistic and is highly sensitive to sound. During free play, the room becomes loud with music and chatter. Tariki begins to cover his ears, shout, and eventually throws a toy.
- This time, Zoe lowers the volume in the room, moves closer to Tariki and says, "I can hear it's loud right now but we don't throw toys. Let's go find a quiet space together."
- Tariki is happy to go outside to the sandpit with Zoe, and begins to calm down. He is supported in co-regulating and learns he has a safe way to manage his overwhelming feelings.
- Zoe's response is an excellent example of positive guidance in action because it is empathetic, responsive, and focused on supporting the child's needs rather than simply managing the behaviour.
- As part of Zoe's induction, positive guidance practices were communicated clearly, and she has also seen these frequently modelled in the centre. She had read Tariki's Individual Support Plan, which was put in place when he joined the centre - part of the early intervention support he received due to his autism.
- The outcome of this interaction is that Tariki feels understood and safe, and is learning what is an acceptable response when he becomes overwhelmed and the relationship between them is strengthened, and Tariki is on his way to learning a self-regulation strategy.

## Slide 104: Time to reflect

When you reflect on your day, how much of your time is spent connecting with tamariki through play, praise, and encouragement, compared to managing behaviour or using instructional language?

When we take time to reflect on our own values, beliefs, and emotional wellbeing, we're better able to show up in ways that support strong, respectful relationships with tamariki. Let's be honest - children's behaviour can sometimes trigger big feelings in us, too. That's totally normal. What matters is being aware of how those feelings are reflected in our words, tone, and actions, and then choosing language that builds trust, not barriers.

**Reflection Questions:**
- How might your background, culture, or past experiences influence how you interpret children's behaviour?
- What is one thing you could do to stay more connected, calm, or curious in moments of challenge?

## Slide 201: Knowing What's Not OK

At BestStart, we are all responsible for ensuring children are treated with dignity and respect, upholding best practices, and addressing immediate concerns. Inappropriate practices by any adult or staff member will not be tolerated.

**Interactive Elements:**
- Click the images to learn more about these unacceptable practices:
  - Ill-treatment of children and young people, whether this is physical, emotional or sexual.
  - Disrespectful practice includes using inappropriate tone volume or language, rough handling children [pushing/pulling], grabbing children by arms, wrists or clothing or ignoring children's emotional needs or withholding care.
  - Physical restraint, where inappropriate physical force is used to prevent, restrict, or subdue the movement of tamariki (or any part of their body) against their will.

## Slide 202: Scenario 1: Is this ill-treatment?

A toddler cries inconsolably after waking from a nap. A teacher rolls their eyes, ignores the child for several minutes, and tells a colleague, "He just wants attention. He'll stop if we don't give in." The child continues crying alone.

**Interactive Elements:**
- How would you rate this practice?
  - Acceptable
  - Not acceptable
- This practice would be considered disrespectful practice and in some cases could also constitute emotional abuse and neglect. Under the Oranga Tamariki Act, child abuse refers to the harming (whether physically, emotionally, or sexually), abuse, neglect, or serious deprivation of any child or young person. This includes actual, potential, and suspected abuse. Withholding comfort can harm a child's sense of safety and belonging. All children deserve emotionally responsive care.

## Slide 203: Scenario 2: Is this disrespectful?

A teacher is rushing a group of children inside. One child hesitates at the doorway. The teacher raises their voice: "Come on! You're holding everyone up!" Then, they gently but firmly grip the child's arm to guide them forward. The child looks startled.

**Interactive Elements:**
- How would you rate this practice?
  - Acceptable
  - Not acceptable
- While the teacher may not intend harm, using an impatient tone and physical handling, especially by the arm, is disrespectful and does not align with responsive practice. BestStart's policy emphasizes a calm, respectful tone and encouraging children at their pace. Behaviours such as inappropriate tone, volume or language, rough handling and moving without respect (pushing/pulling), grabbing by arms, wrists or clothing, failing to meet the physical or emotional needs of children (by ignoring or withholding care) are considered disrespectful, and not tolerated at BestStart.

## Slide 204: Scenario 3: Is this acceptable restraint?

In the playground, a three-year-old climbs on top of an unstable fence. A teacher notices and quickly reaches out, wrapping their arms around the child's torso to lift them down safely. The child screams and kicks, but the teacher remains calm and places them gently on the ground.

**Interactive Elements:**
- How would you rate this practice?
  - Acceptable
  - Not acceptable
- This is an example of safe and ethical use of physical restraint as it was used to prevent imminent harm, using only as much force as needed and for the minimum time necessary. When physical restraint is used outside of these parameters and in a way that prevents, restricts, or subdues the movement of tamariki (or any part of their body) against their will, that would be unacceptable.

## Slide 301: Now What? Putting Positive Guidance into Practice

At BestStart, we are all responsible for ensuring children are treated with dignity and respect, upholding best practices, and addressing immediate concerns. Inappropriate practices by any adult or staff member will not be tolerated. How we can support good positive guidance within our classrooms is by looking at the three core areas.

**Interactive Elements:**
- Click the images to reflect on the three core areas:
  - The learning environment
  - The curriculum
  - Teaching strategies

## Slide 302: Learning environment

The learning environment doesn't just support behaviour - it helps shape it. A calm, inclusive, and well-organised space helps tamariki feel safe, confident, and in control. It reduces challenging behaviours and supports respectful, positive interactions.

**Interactive Elements:**
- Click the hotspots for how you can achieve this:
  - Create a calm, engaging and inclusive space that is welcoming for all, so tamariki feel safe and secure.
  - Review the quantity, quality and accessibility of play resources so that children can make choices that encourage them to engage in sustained and complex play.
  - Establish consistent routines and shared expectations to support the reduction of challenging behaviours and support respectful, positive interactions.
  - Provide an environment that promotes children's sense of belonging, caters to their interests and reflects their contributions.
  - Arrange the environment so that there are distinct spaces for quiet and active types of play.
  - Always ensure clear visual supervision of tamariki to ensure they are safe and to create a sense of safety for all.

## Slide 303: Curriculum

A responsive, well-planned curriculum keeps tamariki engaged, curious, and connected, naturally reducing challenging behaviours. When children see their interests, strengths, and cultures reflected in the programme, they feel valued, settled, engaged and develop a strong sense of belonging.

Consider this example: Anna, a four-year-old, often refuses to join mat time. A teacher says, "She just doesn't like structured Mat times - maybe she'll grow out of it."

**Interactive Elements:**
- What might be missing in the curriculum design?
  - It may not reflect children's strengths/interests.
  - The routines may lack flexibility.
  - There may be missed opportunities for child-led learning.
  - All of the above.

Effective guidance relies on a responsive curriculum that offers both flexibility and meaningful structure. When the curriculum connects with children's interests and strengths, they feel more involved and willing to take initiative. This helps them manage their emotions and build positive relationships with others.

## Slide 304: Round 4: Power of praise

For praise to have a positive impact on behaviour, it needs to be done in the right way. Can you tell your effective praise from ineffective praise? Descriptive praise from proximal praise?

**Interactive Elements:**
- Click the response that matches the type of praise:
  - "Thank you for using your quiet voice. It's helping everyone focus." (Proximal praise)
  - "Wow! Justine is showing such kind hands while she plays. I really appreciate that." (Descriptive praise)

## Slide 401: Beyond Positive Guidance

It's inevitable that even when using positive guidance strategies, children will still display antisocial behaviours. Positive guidance doesn't stop when behaviour is challenging. It becomes even more important to look beneath the behaviour to ask: what is this child trying to tell me? What do they need? What skills are they still learning?

However, some tamariki require additional support or ways of responding to their needs.

**Interactive Elements:**
- Click each image to learn more:
  - Supporting tamariki through early intervention
  - Supporting tamariki with severe behaviour

Supporting tamariki through early intervention:
We play a key role in identifying and supporting children who may require early intervention services. This is support for children from birth to school age with developmental, behavioural, communication, or disability-related needs. If you have any concerns about a child that may require early intervention, it's important to follow the correct procedure outlined in our Positive Guidance Policy.

Supporting tamariki with severe behaviour:
Every child deserves to feel safe in their learning environment. When a child has very high needs and existing strategies haven't worked, their behaviour can sometimes put themselves or others at risk. In these instances, additional support is often required. If there are any instances where a child demonstrates behaviour that puts themselves or others at risk, it's important to follow the correct procedure outlined in our Positive Guidance Policy.

## Slide 503: Congratulations

Great work on completing this course. Remember, positive guidance is something we keep learning and reflecting on so we can continue to build relationships with tamariki and their whanau.
